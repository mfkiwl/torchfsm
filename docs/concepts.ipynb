    "# Concepts\n",
    "There are several key concepts in `torchfsm`, which are key components to construct and solve a PDE. By properly using these components, we can utilize `torchfsm` in a very efficient way.\n",

    "## Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "`Operator` is the key concept in `torchfsm`. It represents a **spatial** operation of a variable. For example, the gradient operator is an operator that computes the gradient of a variable. The divergence operator is an operator that computes the divergence of a variable. The laplacian operator is an operator that computes the laplacian of a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `torchfsm`, there are three types of operator classes: `LinearOperator`, `NonlinearOperator` and `Operator`. `LinearOperator` class represents a linear terms in the context of Fourier Spectal method (See our [Theory Introduction](../theory/#linear-terms)). `NonlinearOperator` class represents a nonlinear terms in the context of Fourier Spectal method. `Operator` class is a combined operator that both contains linear and nonlinear terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "All `Operator` class supports basic linear algebra operations, such as addition, subtraction and multiplication. Thanks to the linear feature of Fourier transformation, we can construct a PDE with different `Operator`s efficiently. For example, we can construct a [Burgers equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation), $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}=-\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$, as follows:"

    "* `integrate`: Integrate the operator in the time dimension. This is mainly used to solve time-dependent PDEs. \n",
