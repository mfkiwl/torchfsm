    "# Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the details of `torchfsm`, let's introduce some key concepts used in the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "`torchfsm` is designed for deep learning applications, and all data is manipulated in the form of PyTorch Tensors. As a result, data shapes follow PyTorch conventions. There are two primary types of data shapes in `torchfsm`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`[B, C, H, ...]`**: This is the most common data shape in `torchfsm`. Here, `B` is the batch size, `C` is the number of channels, and `H, ...` represent spatial dimensions. For example, 32 2D vector fields on a 64×64 mesh can be represented as `[32, 1, 64, 64]`. All inputs to the `Operator` class should conform to this shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`[B, T, C, H, ...]`**: This shape is used to store trajectory data, where `T` represents the number of time steps (solution frames) in the trajectory. For example, 32 2D vector fields on a 64×64 mesh over 100 time steps can be represented as `[32, 100, 2, 64, 64]`. This shape is typically used as the output when solving time-dependent PDEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `torchfsm`, we also introduce type annotations to help users supply valid inputs to functions. These type annotations are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SpatialTensor`: A tensor in physical space.\n",
    "- `SpatialArray`: A NumPy array in physical space.\n",
    "- `FourierTensor`: A tensor in Fourier space (i.e., a complex-valued tensor).\n",
    "- `FourierArray`: A NumPy array in Fourier space (i.e., a complex-valued array).\n",
    "\n",
    "These types can also be combined with shape annotations. For example, `SpatialTensor[\"B C H ...\"]` indicates a tensor in physical space with the shape `[B, C, H, ...]`.\n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"admonition note\">\n",
    "    <p class=\"admonition-title\">Note</p>\n",
    "    <p>\n",
    "        \"SpatialTensor\" and \"FourierTensor\" are not actual PyTorch tensor types. They are type annotations intended to clarify the expected data format.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Operator` is a central concept in `torchfsm`. It represents a **spatial** operation applied to a variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **gradient** operator computes the gradient of a variable.\n",
    "- The **divergence** operator computes the divergence of a variable.\n",
    "- The **Laplacian** operator computes the Laplacian of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of operator classes in `torchfsm`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LinearOperator`: Represents linear terms in the context of the Fourier spectral method.\n",
    "- `NonlinearOperator`: Represents nonlinear terms.\n",
    "- `Operator`: A composite class that can include both linear and nonlinear components.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on linear terms, see our [Theory Introduction](../../theory/#linear-terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "All `Operator` classes support basic linear algebra operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Thanks to the linearity of the Fourier transform, it's efficient to construct PDEs using combinations of different `Operator`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the [Burgers' equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers%27_equation),\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} = -\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u} + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "can be constructed as follows:\n"

    "There are three important functions for `Operator` classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__call__`: Calling the operator as a function directly will return the result of applying the operator to the input. This is useful for evaluating complex spatial derivatives.\n",
    "- `integrate`: Integrates the operator over the time dimension. This is primarily used to solve time-dependent PDEs.\n",
    "- `solve`: Solves the linear operation given a right-hand side. This function only works for the `LinearOperator` class and is typically used for solving time-independent problems, such as the Poisson equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In later sections, we will explain how to use these functions in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "All available operators in `torchfsm` are summarized in the [cheat sheet](../cheatsheet/#operators).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Fourier spectral method, all boundary conditions are periodic, and internal obstacles within the domain are not supported. Therefore, `torchfsm` uses a simplified `Mesh` to represent the spatial domain. The `Mesh` is another key concept in `torchfsm`, encapsulating the domain size and grid resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "All basic operations in an `Operator` class require a mesh as input. The mesh can be one of the following types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`mesh_info` (`Sequence[tuple[float, float, int]]`)**: A sequence of tuples, where each tuple represents a spatial dimension. Each tuple contains three elements: the start of the domain, the end of the domain, and the number of grid points. For example, `mesh_info = [(0, 1, 64), (0, 1, 64)]` represents a 2D domain of size $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$ with grid spacing $dx = dy = 1/64$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`MeshGrid`**: An iterable class that represents a mesh grid. This class is especially useful for generating initial conditions. Its length corresponds to the number of dimensions in the mesh. The attributes `x`, `y`, and `z` provide mesh grids for the first three dimensions. For additional dimensions, you can access the mesh grid via indexing (e.g., `mesh_grid[0]` for the first dimension, which is equivalent to `x`). There is no limit to the number of dimensions. If the number of points in each dimension is $n_1, n_2, n_3, \\dots, n_k$, the full mesh grid shape is `(n_1, n_2, n_3, ..., n_k)`. The shapes of attributes `x`, `y`, `z` are `(n_1)`, `(n_2)`, `(n_3)` respectively. `MeshGrid` can be initialized with a `mesh_info`, along with optional keywords to specify the device and data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`FourierMesh`**: A class that contains FFT frequency information and basic derivative operators used in the Fourier spectral method. This class is used internally by `Operator` objects. All other mesh types are converted to a `FourierMesh` inside an `Operator`. If you're using multiple operators and want to save memory, you should create and pass a `FourierMesh` directly. Otherwise, each operator will create its own `FourierMesh` instance with identical content. `FourierMesh` can be initialized using either a `mesh_info` or a `MeshGrid` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these mesh types can be used in the three main functions of the `Operator` class mentioned above. They can also be assigned to an operator using the `register_mesh` method. Once a mesh is registered, you no longer need to pass it explicitly when calling operator functions. A mesh is automatically registered the first time it is passed to any operator method.\n"
